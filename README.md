# Loan-Calculator-Mini-Project

The mini project is implemented in HTML5, Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript. The project takes Principal amount, Rate of Interest and Years to Repay as input to display Monthly Payment, Total Payment and Total Interest amount after calculation. This project helped me understand basic JavaScript concepts.
